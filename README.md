Iterative methods for solving systems of linear algebraic equations.
Systems of linear algebraic equations are solved with the aid of simple iteration method, Jacobi's Method, Seidel methods and relaxation.

Different norms of matrices are calculated, a priori and a posteriori estimation of the number of iterations are calculated.
Iterations methods are realized with different iteration parameters to choose the best one.
